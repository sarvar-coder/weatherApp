# weatherApp
Swift Arcade
 some core techniques underlying throughout building this app

- create new projects without storyboards
- scalling better with vector assets
- supporting dark mode 
- learn the basics of autolayout 
- the beauty of dynamic fonts 
- Delegation pattern 
- MVVM pattern 
- Getting data nsurlsession and parsing in JSON 

## Day 1 

the first video in playlist is about first intro how to professionally building ios app flow. Also we learnt creating project without storyboard, explaining vector assets and its usefullness. They are mathematically calculated and that's why very looks beautifull, discussing auto-layout 


## Day 2 
- Intro auto layout 
- what auotlyout is ?
autolayout is mathematically constraints that apple uses dynamically layout and postions its views
this is how our app able to render themselves with one set of definiton  on variety of differently sized devices

today we're introduced how ios app can render themselves by using autolayout. And how to use them rightly and pottentilally.

## Day 3
This day content contains only shortcuts for using Xcode like pro and also saves time the way more productivity
Due to this video is short and very easy to understand. So i skip this and go directly fourth day video.


## Day 4 
Today's goal is Simplifying layout with Stackview. Therefore the content will be stackview and how to use them smartly.
Imagine: 
We need to layout three things text, image and button. It should be from top to bottom.
Each Components require us to set four constraints for each them and as it is seen takes up energy and time.
If we used stackview and added these views to stackView then we would need to set four constraints only to stackView 
By doing that we can minimize the constraints numbers.

on this day we completed the design of the app
